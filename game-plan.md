- ### Story
	- Robert lands at the airport.
		- it was a (length) flight, and `#{name}` can't wait to get out of the airport and start exploring the city. It's their first time leaving the country and they can't wait to start this new experience.

	- Greeted by immigration
		- name's first international experience is being met by the immigration official at the gate.  The official asked for name's passport with a (light/heavy) accent. The official was (friendly/cold/standoff-ish) and waved name through after verifying their passport.

	- Weather (is it hot/cold?)
		- name took a deep breath and inhaled the (warm/cold) air outside the airport. While waiting for the (type of transport), they decided to (add/remove) clothing to be more comfortable.  While loading into the (transportation) name noticed everyone was very (considerate/uncaring) about personal space.

	- take transportation to the lodging
		- name arrived at the (type of lodging) and got a key to the room.  They went to their room and unloaded all their baggage.  After a big sigh of relief, name decided to go back out to the bar located at the (lodging).  Name ordered a (drink) and looked around to take in their surroundings.  They noticed a lot of people (talking with their hands/ speaking the local language / being loud or quiet).  This was definitely different from home!

	- go to a restaurant
    name started to get hungry, and the bar didn't have much food to offer, so they decided to head out and find a restaurant.
	- Note architecture?
    On the (walk/ride) to a restaurant recommended by the (lodging) staff, name noticed how (unique/different) every street looked to each other.  The buildings were very (dense/spread out) with a very (historical style?) flavor, and there were (many/not many) people out walking around.  This made sense, since it was a weekend.

	- buy local dish and local alcohol
    At the restaurant, name chose (dish type) because they'd never seen or tasted it before.  The beginning of a new adventure! They chose to drink (drink type) as it seemed to be what many of the other patrons were having.  When in Rome, which we are not, why not partake?

	- do a social event (club/parade/gallery)
    All the travel books say that you should visit (gallery/landmark name) while you're there, so name decided that would be a good way to learn about the culture a little more authentically. While there, name saw how busy the streets were, even late in the evening. Amazing how different this was from home!

	- Go to bed
    Name lost track of time, and soon enough it was time to get some rest to recharge for the next day.  They also had to get some sleep to make up for the jet-lag they were feeling.

	- Wake up (early?)
    Breakfast was the first order of business. (Type of food) was a local favorite, so name dove in with the hunger of someone who knew they would have a long day coming up.

	- sight-seeing (landmarks, parks)
    Name decided to go see (landmark/thing) as they'd always seen pictures in magazines. Photos could not do it justice, and name thought it could be one of the 7 wonders of the world!  The scale and historical significance was staggering in person.

	- Went shopping to get clothes that help you blend in
    With the (landmark/thing) still on their mind, name went to find some clothes more appropriate for the weather and local culture.  They'd brought things to keep them (warm/cool) but you can only pack so well on your first international journey!  Name walked out of the store wearing (local clothing) and only feeling slightly like a tourist.  All that shopping sure works up an appetite.

	- Get lunch (street food, cafe) (were people nice? excited to see you?)
    Name saw an ad for the local game tonight and purchased a ticket for the event.  Since it was getting close to time, name decided to walk to the stadium as it was just a few blocks away.  In America, everyone knows that food in stadiums is a complete rip-off, so name decided to stop at a (cart/cafe) to fill up their belly before the game.
    Name saw a crowd at one of the (food stand type) and decided join in. If they all thought it was delicious, there must be something to it.  After a short wait, name got (food name) and turned down the street towards the stadium.

	- Go watch a sporting event in person (famous team/sport) - something unique about the team
